## About GaiaDAO
In Greek mythology, Gaia (/ˈɡeɪə; from Ancient Greek meaning "land" or "earth") is the personification of the Earth and one of the Greek primordial deities. Gaia was seen as the ancestral mother of all life. We wanted a name that would represent our commitment to bringing meaningful change to the planet, while reflecting on how we value community.

Gaia is a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) that aims to create an ecosystem of prominent DeFi products on the BSC blockchain while supporting environmental and philanthropic organizations.

At Gaia, we believe that token holders should be able to vote on all aspects of the project - including the protocol's future development path. As a result, the community will decide on marketing decisions, protocol parameters, future tokens and any smart contract changes. This includes any subsequent projects built by the DAO as well as which organizations Gaia will support.

We don't want to just support the environment, but those that live within it as well. So while offsetting the environmental impact of blockchain technology will be a large focus, so will animal conservation and support for people in developing countries.

Imagine a worldwide network of supporters working together to make the world a better place. We can plant trees in the Amazon, sponsor endangered animals in Indonesia and help fund a small business in Sri Lanka - all on the same day!

Remember, every trip to the Moon starts from Earth :earth_americas:.
